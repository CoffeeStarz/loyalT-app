LoyalT Coffee Rewards Card App
=====================

A loyalty rewards program for our favorite coffee cart in NYC financial district, Esprezzatura.

For every 10 coffees you buy, you can redeem a reward for one free drip coffee. For every 15 you buy, you can redeem a reward for a specialty drink (red-eye, PSL etc.). 


## For Developers

After cloning the repo and `cd loyalT-app`, run `npm install`. If you don't have ionic, cordova, gulp, bower etc, `npm install -g ionic cordova, gulp, bower`.

Once you've `npm install`ed your required dependencies, you should run `ionic platform <PLATFORM>` where `<PLATFORM>` is ios or android. 

To run the code in the browser, you can run the command `ionic serve`. If you have a device connected, you can run `ionic build <PLATFORM>` and then `ionic run <PLATFORM>`. If you don't have Android Studio & Oracle JDK or XCODE, you may run into some issues.

Below you'll find the README.md that comes with Ionic boilerplate app.

Ionic App Base
=====================

A starting project for Ionic that optionally supports using custom SCSS.

## Using this project

We recommend using the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli) to create new Ionic projects that are based on this project but use a ready-made starter template.

For example, to start a new Ionic project with the default tabs interface, make sure the `ionic` utility is installed:

```bash
$ npm install -g ionic
```

Then run: 

```bash
$ ionic start myProject tabs
```

More info on this can be found on the Ionic [Getting Started](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started) page and the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli) repo.
